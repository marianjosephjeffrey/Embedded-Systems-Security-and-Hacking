# 🔧 Embedded Systems Security and Hacking  

## 📌 Overview  
As part of an **embedded systems security course at the University of Maryland**, I conducted **hardware security analysis, firmware extraction, and vulnerability assessment** on a **digital video recorder (DVR)**. This project involved **reverse engineering, debugging embedded hardware, and testing exploitability** with various security tools.

## 🛠 Key Contributions  

- 📜 **Performed a comprehensive hardware security analysis** of a **DVR system**, assessing its security against **current industry standards**.  
- 🛠 **Disassembled and extracted firmware** from the device for **static and dynamic vulnerability analysis**.  
- 🔍 **Identified security weaknesses in the firmware**, mapping them to **Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)**.  
- ⚡ **Attempted Return Oriented Programming (ROP) exploitation**, although unsuccessful, analyzed potential attack vectors.  
- 🏴‍☠️ **Used JTAG and UART debugging interfaces** to analyze **device communication and security flaws**.  
- 🔐 **Documented findings in a detailed security report**, providing **mitigation strategies** to improve **firmware security**.
